2. Print words that have 't' in them by swapping 1st letter with 2nd, 3rd letter with 4th etc.

Accept the input string from the user. Print all the words that have letter 't' in them by swapping 1st letter with 2nd letter, 3rd letter with 4th letter etc.

 

If there is only one letter in the word, leave it as it is.

If there are odd number of letters in the word, leave the last letter as it is (no swapping needed).

If there is no letter 't' in the input string, print "None".

 

Assume there will be maximum of 10 words of 20 characters maximum length in the input.
